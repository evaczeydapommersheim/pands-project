## Fisher's Iris Dataset

### Project Plan:

1. Research dataset online and summarize learnings.

> The Iris Dataset was created by Sir Ronlad Aymler Fisher in 1936 in his paper called "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems". R.A. Fisher was a British polymath and biologist, an academic person working in multiple fields of science such as mathematics, statistics, genetics.
> The Iris dataset is one of the first historical datasets used for multivariate data analysis.
> The dataset consists of 50 samples of 3 different types of the Iris flower (Iris-setosa, Iris-Versicolour and Iris-Virginica). Each sample is described based on 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width), all four features measured in cm-s.
> The dataset has been analyzed by multiple papers. It is a simple enough dataset which can be and is commonly used to understand concepts of data analytics and machine learning, determining similarities and differences between the 3 flower species and using the data for prediction, modelling purposes. The data can be presented in various ways to allow conclusions to be drawn using the variables/features and use the outcomes to reflect on the 3 species/classification of the Iris flower.

2. Determine what code/python library can be used to analyze the dataset
    a. Research sklearn for machine learning
  
3. Prepare analysis.py file
    a. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file
    b. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files
    c. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables

4. Incorporate analysis by other sources and use as part of argument/conclusion
  
5. Document every source under reference section
